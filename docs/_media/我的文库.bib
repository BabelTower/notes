  abstract = {Building on realized variance and bipower variation measures constructed from high-frequency financial prices, we propose a simple reduced form framework for effectively incorporating intraday data into the modeling of daily return volatility. We decompose the total daily return variability into the continuous sample path variance, the variation arising from discontinuous jumps that occur during the trading day, as well as the overnight return variance. Our empirical results, based on long samples of highfrequency equity and bond futures returns, suggest that the dynamic dependencies in the daily continuous sample path variability are well described by an approximate long-memory HAR–GARCH model, while the overnight returns may be modeled by an augmented GARCH type structure. The dynamic dependencies in the non-parametrically identified significant jumps appear to be well described by the combination of an ACH model for the time-varying jump intensities coupled with a relatively simple log-linear structure for the jump sizes. Finally, we discuss how the resulting reduced form model structure for each of the three components may be used in the construction of out-of-sample forecasts for the total return volatility.},

  abstract = {Graph clustering is successfully applied in various applications for finding similar patterns. Recently, deep learning- based autoencoder has been used efficiently for detecting disjoint clusters. However, in real-world graphs, vertices may belong to multiple clusters. Thus, it is obligatory to analyze the membership of vertices toward clusters. Furthermore, existing approaches are centralized and are inefficient in handling large graphs. In this paper, a deep learning-based model ‘DFuzzy’ is proposed for finding fuzzy clusters from large graphs in distributed environment. It performs clustering in three phases. In first phase, pre-training is performed by initializing the candidate cluster centers. Then, fine tuning is performed to learn the latent representations by mining the local information and capturing the structure using PageRank. Further, modularity is used to redefine clusters. In last phase, reconstruction error is minimized and final cluster centers are updated. Experiments are performed over real-life graph data, and the performance of DFuzzy is compared with four state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Results show that DFuzzy scales up linearly to handle large graphs and produces better quality of clusters when compared to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. It is also observed that deep structures can help in getting better graph representations and provide improved clustering performance.},

  abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis. Recently, deep clustering, which derives inspiration primarily from deep learning approaches, achieves state-of-the-art performance and has attracted considerable attention. Current deep clustering methods usually boost the clustering results by means of the powerful representation ability of deep learning, e.g., autoencoder, suggesting that learning an effective representation for clustering is a crucial requirement. The strength of deep clustering methods is to extract the useful representations from the data itself, rather than the structure of data, which receives scarce attention in representation learning. Motivated by the great success of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in encoding the graph structure, we propose a Structural Deep Clustering Network (SDCN) to integrate the structural information into deep clustering. Specifically, we design a delivery operator to transfer the representations learned by autoencoder to the corresponding GCN layer, and a dual self-supervised mechanism to unify these two different deep neural architectures and guide the update of the whole model. In this way, the multiple structures of data, from low-order to high-order, are naturally combined with the multiple representations learned by autoencoder. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the delivery operator, i.e., with the delivery operator, GCN improves the autoencoder-specific representation as a high-order graph regularization constraint and autoencoder helps alleviate the over-smoothing problem in GCN. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our propose model can consistently perform better over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, due to rapid increases in the scale and diversity of networks, the modular organization at the global level in many large networks is often extremely difficult to recognize. In this paper, we propose a new method based on deep learning on ground-truth communities, with the aim of revealing community structure in large real-world networks. The contributions of this paper are 1) proposing an edge-to-image (E2I) model that can transfer the edge structure to an image structure; 2) construction of a community network (ComNet) to classify the two types of edges, which are those in the same community and others between different communities; 3) making it easier to obtain local views of network communities by breadth-first search based on edge classification; and 4) merging preliminary communities with local modularity R, making it easy to optimize the community structure and obtain the final community structure of given networks. The experimental results show that the proposed edge classification method based on deep convolution neural networks can increase the accuracy of community structure evaluation compared with the existing methods in computer-generated networks and large-scale real-world networks.},

Different from other previous research efforts, we adopt a random surfing model to capture graph structural information directly, instead of using the samplingbased method for generating linear sequences proposed by Perozzi et al. (2014). The advantages of our approach will be illustrated from both theorical and empirical perspectives. We also give a new perspective for the matrix factorization method proposed by Levy and Goldberg (2014), in which the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix is considered as an analytical solution to the objective function of the skipgram model with negative sampling proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013). Unlike their approach which involves the use of the SVD for finding the low-dimensitonal projections from the PMI matrix, however, the stacked denoising autoencoder is introduced in our model to extract complex features and model non-linearities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on clustering and visualization tasks, employing the learned vertex representations as features. Empirical results on datasets of varying sizes show that our model outperforms other stat-of-the-art models in such tasks.},

Community detection is an               ill-defined problem               , as the nature of the communities is not known in advance. The problem has turned even more complicated due to the fact that communities emerge in the network in various forms such as disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchical. Various heuristics have been proposed to address these challenges, depending on the application in hand. All these heuristics have been materialized in the form of new               metrics               , which in most cases are used as optimization functions for detecting the community structure, or provide an indication of the goodness of detected communities during evaluation. Over the last decade, a large number of such metrics have been proposed. Thus, there arises a need for an organized and detailed survey of the metrics proposed for community detection and evaluation. Here, we present a survey of the start-of-the-art metrics used for the detection and the evaluation of community structure. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and real networks to present a comparative analysis of these metrics in measuring the goodness of the underlying community structure.},

However, existing methods cannot allocate learnable weights to different nodes in the neighborhood and lack of robustness on account of neglecting both node attributes and graph reconstruction. Moreover, most of multi-view GNNs mainly focus on the case of multiple graphs, while designing GNNs for solving graph-structured data of multi-view attributes is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Attribute Graph Convolution Networks (MAGCN) model for the clustering task. MAGCN is designed with two-pathway encoders that map graph embedding features and learn view-consistency information. Specifically, the first pathway develops multiview attribute graph attention networks to reduce the noise/redundancy and learn the graph embedding features of multi-view graph data. The second pathway develops consistent embedding encoders to capture the geometric relationship and the consistency of probability distribution among different views, which adaptively finds a consistent clustering embedding space for multi-view attributes. Experiments on three benchmark graph databases show the effectiveness of our method compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Focusing on random graph families such as the stochastic block model, recent research has unified both approaches and identified both statistical and computational detection thresholds in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. By recasting community detection as a node-wise classification problem on graphs, we can also study it from a learning perspective. We present a novel family of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for solving community detection problems in a supervised learning setting. We show that, in a data-driven manner and without access to the underlying generative models, they can match or even surpass the performance of the belief propagation algorithm on binary and multiclass stochastic block models, which is believed to reach the computational threshold in these cases. In particular, we propose to augment GNNs with the non-backtracking operator defined on the line graph of edge adjacencies. The GNNs are achieved good performance on real-world datasets. In addition, we perform the first analysis of the optimization landscape of using (linear) GNNs to solve community detection problems, demonstrating that under certain simplifications and assumptions, the loss value at any local minimum is close to the loss value at the global minimum/minima.},

However, most of the existing methods like spectral clustering suffer from the sparsity, scalability, robustness and handling high dimensional raw information in clustering. To address this issue, we propose a deep probabilistic model, called Variational Graph Embedding and Clustering with Laplacian Eigenmaps (VGECLE), which learns node embeddings and assigns node clusters simultaneously. It represents each node as a Gaussian distribution to disentangle the true embedding position and the uncertainty from the graph. With a Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) prior, VGECLE is capable of learning an interpretable clustering by the variational inference and generative process. In order to learn the pairwise relationships better, we propose a Teacher-Student mechanism encouraging node to learn a better Gaussian from its instant neighbors in the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training fashion. By optimizing the graph embedding and the graph clustering problem as a whole, our model can fully take the advantages in their correlation. To our best knowledge, we are the first to tackle graph clustering in a deep probabilistic viewpoint. We perform extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks to corroborate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy—using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

  abstract = {Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) has recently been a popular framework of choice for learning representations on graphs. Its inception has allowed models to achieve state-of-the-art performances for challenging tasks such as link prediction, rating prediction and node clustering. However, a fundamental flaw exists in Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches. Specifically, the objective function of VAE (reconstruction loss), deviates from its primary objective (i.e clustering). In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by introducing two significant changes to Variational Graph Autoencoder for Community Detection (VGAECD). Firstly, we introduce a simplified graph convolution encoder to increase convergence speed and reduce computational time. Secondly, a dual variational objective is introduced to encourage learning of the primary objective. The outcome is a faster converging model with competitive community detection performance.},

Classical approaches for community detection usually deal only with the structure of the network and ignore features of the nodes (traditionally called node attributes), although the majority of real-world social networks provide additional actors’ information such as age, gender, interests, etc. It is believed that the attributes may clarify and enrich the knowledge about the actors and give sense to the detected communities. This belief has motivated the progress in developing community detection methods that use both the structure and the attributes of the network (modeled already via a node-attributed graph) to yield more informative and qualitative community detection results.},

In this article, we show that the residuals of commonly used time-series models for realized volatility and logarithmic realized variance exhibit non-Gaussianity and volatility clustering. We propose extensions to explicitly account for these properties and assess their relevance for modeling and forecasting realized volatility. In an empirical application for S\&P 500 index futures we show that allowing for time-varying volatility of realized volatility and logarithmic realized variance substantially improves the fit as well as predictive performance. Furthermore, the distributional assumption for residuals plays a crucial role in density forecasting.},

  abstract = {Attributed graph embedding, which learns vector representations from graph topology and node features, is a challenging task for graph analysis. Recently, methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have made great progress on this task. However, existing GCN-based methods have three major drawbacks. Firstly, our experiments indicate that the entanglement of graph convolutional filters and weight matrices will harm both the performance and robustness. Secondly, we show that graph convolutional filters in these methods reveal to be special cases of generalized Laplacian smoothing filters, but they do not preserve optimal low-pass characteristics. Finally, the training objectives of existing algorithms are usually recovering the adjacency matrix or feature matrix, which are not always consistent with real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Graph Encoder (AGE), a novel attributed graph embedding framework. AGE consists of two modules: (1) To better alleviate the high-frequency noises in the node features, AGE first applies a carefully-designed Laplacian smoothing filter. (2) AGE employs an adaptive encoder that iteratively strengthens the filtered features for better node embeddings. We conduct experiments using four public benchmark datasets to validate AGE on node clustering and link prediction tasks. Experimental results show that AGE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph embedding methods considerably on these tasks.},

However the continuous, exponential growth of these networks (both in terms of number of users, and in terms of the variety of different interactions that these networks allow) has made the development of efficient and effective community detection techniques a challenging computational task. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for Semi-supervised Community Detection, exploiting Convolutional Neural Networks to simultaneously leverage different properties of a network — such as topological and context information. Crucially, computational cost is optimized by building on the insight that representing network connections over particular sparse matrices can significantly decrease the number of operations that need to be explicitly performed. By extensively evaluating our system on large (artificial and real-world) datasets, we show that our approach outperforms a variety of existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of running time, as well as over Macro− and Micro − F 1.},

  abstract = {Multi-view graph clustering, which seeks a partition of the graph with multiple views that often provide more comprehensive yet complex information, has received considerable attention in recent years. Although some efforts have been made for multi-view graph clustering and achieve decent performances, most of them employ shallow model to deal with the complex relation within multiview graph, which may seriously restrict the capacity for modeling multi-view graph information. In this paper, we make the first attempt to employ deep learning technique for attributed multiview graph clustering, and propose a novel task-guided One2Multi graph autoencoder clustering framework. The One2Multi graph autoencoder is able to learn node embeddings by employing one informative graph view and content data to reconstruct multiple graph views. Hence, the shared feature representation of multiple graphs can be well captured. Furthermore, a self-training clustering objective is proposed to iteratively improve the clustering results. By integrating the self-training and autoencoder’s reconstruction into a unified framework, our model can jointly optimize the cluster label assignments and embeddings suitable for graph clustering. Experiments on real-world attributed multi-view graph datasets well validate the effectiveness of our model.},

  abstract = {A large number of real-world graphs or networks are inherently heterogeneous, involving a diversity of node types and relation types. Heterogeneous graph embedding is to embed rich structural and semantic information of a heterogeneous graph into low-dimensional node representations. Existing models usually define multiple metapaths in a heterogeneous graph to capture the composite relations and guide neighbor selection. However, these models either omit node content features, discard intermediate nodes along the metapath, or only consider one metapath. To address these three limitations, we propose a new model named Metapath Aggregated Graph Neural Network (MAGNN) to boost the final performance. Specifically, MAGNN employs three major components, i.e., the node content transformation to encapsulate input node attributes, the intra-metapath aggregation to incorporate intermediate semantic nodes, and the inter-metapath aggregation to combine messages from multiple metapaths. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification, node clustering, and link prediction show that MAGNN achieves more accurate prediction results than state-of-the-art baselines.},

It is to learn the lowdimensional representation for nodes in a network, which benefits downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Most of the existing approaches learn node representations only based on the topological structure, yet nodes are often associated with rich attributes in many real-world applications. Thus, it is important and necessary to learn node representations based on both the topological structure and node attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel deep attributed network embedding approach, which can capture the high nonlinearity and preserve various proximities in both topological structure and node attributes. At the same time, a novel strategy is proposed to guarantee the learned node representation can encode the consistent and complementary information from the topological structure and node attributes.

  abstract = {Network embedding has attracted increasing attention in recent few years, which is to learn a low-dimensional representation for each node of a network to benefit downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and network visualization. Essentially, the task of network embedding can be decoupled into discovering the proximity in the original space and preserving it in the lowdimensional space. Only with the well-discovered proximity can we preserve it in the low-dimensional space. Thus, it is critical to discover the proximity between different nodes to learn good node representations. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel proximity generative adversarial network (ProGAN) which can generate proximities. As a result, the generated proximity can help to discover the complicated underlying proximity to benefit network embedding. To generate proximities, we design a novel neural network architecture to fulfill it. In particular, the generation of proximities is instantiated to the generation of triplets of nodes, which encodes the similarity relationship between different nodes. In this way, the proposed ProGAN can generate proximities successfully to benefit network embedding. At last, extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of ProGAN.},

  abstract = {This paper examines whether structural breaks contain incremental information for forecasting the volatility of copper futures. Considering structural breaks in volatility, we develop four heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models based on classical or latest HAR-type models. Subsequently, we apply these models to forecast volatility in the copper futures market. The empirical results reveal that our models exhibit better in-sample and out-of-sample performances than classical or latest HAR-type models. This suggests that structural breaks contain incremental prediction information for the volatility of copper futures. More importantly, we argue that considering structural breaks can improve the performances of most of existing HAR-type models. Highlights There are many structural break points in return volatility of the copper futures. We propose 12 new heterogeneous autoregressive models. Our models outperform the existing heterogeneous autoregressive models. Structural breaks contain additional ex ante information for volatility forecasting. The ex ante information is obvious in forecasting mid- and long-term volatilities.},

  abstract = {Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely useful in a variety of prediction tasks, from content recommendation to identifying protein functions. However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node’s local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

Graph convolutional network (GCN), a new deep-learning technique, has recently been developed for community detection. Markov Random Fields (MRF) has been combined with GCN in the MRFasGCN method to improve accuracy. However, the existing GCN community-finding methods are semi-supervised, even though community finding is essentially an unsupervised learning problem. We developed a new GCN approach for unsupervised community detection under the framework of Autoencoder. We cast MRFasGCN as an encoder and then derived node community membership in the hidden layer of the encoder. We introduced a community-centric dual decoder to reconstruct network structures and node attributes separately in an unsupervised fashion, for faithful community detection in the input space. We designed a scheme of local enhancement to accommodate nodes to have more common neighbors and similar attributes with similar community memberships. Experimental results on real networks showed that our new method outperformed the best existing methods, showing the effectiveness of the novel decoding mechanism for generating links and attributes together over the commonly used methods for reconstructing links alone.},

  abstract = {Neighborhood aggregation algorithms like spectral graph convolutional networks (GCNs) formulate graph convolutions as a symmetric Laplacian smoothing operation to aggregate the feature information of one node with that of its neighbors. While they have achieved great success in semisupervised node classification on graphs, current approaches suffer from the over-smoothing problem when the depth of the neural networks increases, which always leads to a noticeable degradation of performance. To solve this problem, we present graph convolutional ladder-shape networks (GCLN), a novel graph neural network architecture that transmits messages from shallow layers to deeper layers to overcome the over-smoothing problem and dramatically extend the scale of the neural networks with improved performance. We have validated the effectiveness of proposed GCLN at a node-wise level with a semi-supervised task (node classification) and an unsupervised task (node clustering), and at a graph-wise level with graph classification by applying a differentiable pooling operation. The proposed GCLN outperforms original GCNs, deep GCNs and other state-of-the-art GCN-based models for all three tasks, which were designed from various perspectives on six real-world benchmark data sets.},

One of the most important features in these networks is the existence of community structure. In recent years, many community detection algorithms have been proposed to unveil the structural properties and dynamic behaviors of networks. In this study, we attempt a contemporary survey on the methods of community detection and its applications in the various domains of real life. Besides highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each community detection approach, different aspects of algorithmic performance comparison and their testing on standard benchmarks are discussed. The challenges faced by community detection algorithms, open issues and future trends related to community detection are also postulated. The main goal of this paper is to put forth a review of prevailing community detection algorithms that range from traditional algorithms to state of the art algorithms for overlapping community detection. Algorithms based on dimensionality reduction techniques such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) are also focused. This study will serve as an up-to-date report on the evolution of community detection and its potential applications in various domains from real world networks.},

  abstract = {Community detection refers to the task of discovering groups of vertices sharing similar properties or functions so as to understand the network data. With the recent development of deep learning, graph representation learning techniques are also utilized for community detection. However, the communities can only be inferred by applying clustering algorithms based on learned vertex embeddings. These general cluster algorithms like K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model cannot output much overlapped communities, which have been proved to be very common in many real-world networks. In this paper, we propose CommunityGAN, a novel community detection framework that jointly solves overlapping community detection and graph representation learning. First, unlike the embedding of conventional graph representation learning algorithms where the vector entry values have no specific meanings, the embedding of CommunityGAN indicates the membership strength of vertices to communities. Second, a specifically designed Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) is adopted to optimize such embedding. Through the minimax competition between the motif-level generator and discriminator, both of them can alternatively and iteratively boost their performance and finally output a better community structure. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate that CommunityGAN achieves substantial community detection performance gains over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Networks have been widely used to represent the relations between objects such as academic networks and social networks, and learning embedding for networks has thus garnered plenty of research attention. Self-supervised network representation learning aims at extracting node embedding without external supervision. Recently, maximizing the mutual information between the local node embedding and the global summary (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, or DGI for short) has shown promising results on many downstream tasks such as node classification. However, there are two major limitations of DGI. Firstly, DGI merely considers the extrinsic supervision signal (i.e., the mutual information between node embedding and global summary) while ignores the intrinsic signal (i.e., the mutual dependence between node embedding and node attributes). Secondly, nodes in a real-world network are usually connected by multiple edges with different relations, while DGI does not fully explore the various relations among nodes. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose a novel framework, called High-order Deep Multiplex Infomax (HDMI), for learning node embedding on multiplex networks in a self-supervised way. To be more specific, we first design a joint supervision signal containing both extrinsic and intrinsic mutual information by high-order mutual information, and we propose a High-order Deep Infomax (HDI) to optimize the proposed supervision signal. Then we propose an attention based fusion module to combine node embedding from different layers of the multiplex network. Finally, we evaluate the proposed HDMI on various downstream tasks such as unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. The experimental results show that HDMI achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

It has been applied to many applications, e.g., network community detection and user recommendation. One of the recent research topics for network embedding has been focusing on exploitation of diverse information, including network topology and semantic information on nodes of networks. However, such diverse information has not been fully utilized nor adequately integrated in the existing methods, so that the resulting network embedding is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we develop a weight-free multi-component network embedding approach by network reconstruction via a deep Autoencoder. Three key components make our new approach effective, i.e., a uniformed graph representation of network topology and semantic information, enhancement to the graph representation using local network structure (i.e., pairwise relationship on nodes) by sampling with latent space regularization, and integration of the diverse information in graph forms in a deep Autoencoder. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world networks demonstrate a superior performance of our method over nine state-of-the-art methods for embedding.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal forecasting has various applications in neuroscience, climate and transportation domain. Traffic forecasting is one canonical example of such learning task. The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world large scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of 12\% - 15\% over state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Network (DNN) has achieved impressive success in the domain of Euclidean data such as image. However, designing deep neural network to cluster nodes especially in social networks is still a challenging task. Moreover, recent advanced methods for node clustering have focused on learning node embedding, upon which classic clustering algorithms like K-means are applied. Nevertheless, the resulting node embeddings are customarily taskagnostic. This results in the fact that the performance of clustering is difficult to guarantee. To effectively mitigate the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel clustering-oriented node embedding method named Deep Node Clustering (DNC) for non-attributed network data by resorting to deep neural networks. We first present a preprocessing method via adopting a random surfing model to capture graph structural information directly. Subsequently, we propose to learn a deep clustering network, which could jointly learn node embedding and cluster assignments. Extensive experiments on three real-world network datasets for node clustering are conducted, which demonstrate that the proposed DNC substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art node clustering methods.},

The current methods usually learn node representation by describing its neighborhood as a perceptual whole in a holistic manner while ignoring the entanglement of the latent factors. However, a real-world graph is formed by the complex interaction of many latent factors (e.g., the same hobby, education or work in social network). While little effort has been made toward exploring the disentangled representation in GCNs. In this paper, we propose a novel Independence Promoted Graph Disentangled Networks (IPGDN) to learn disentangled node representation while enhancing the independence among node representations. In particular, we firstly present disentangled representation learning by neighborhood routing mechanism, and then employ the HilbertSchmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to enforce independence between the latent representations, which is effectively integrated into a graph convolutional framework as a regularizer at the output layer. Experimental studies on realworld graphs validate our model and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-arts by a wide margin in different network applications, including semi-supervised graph classification, graph clustering and graph visualization.},

Despite the previous success, existing multi-graph clustering methods mostly use shallow models, which are incapable to capture the highly non-linear structures and the complex cluster associations in multigraph, thus result in sub-optimal results. Inspired by the powerful representation learning capability of neural networks, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model to simultaneously infer cluster assignments and cluster associations in multi-graph. Specifically, we use autoencoding networks to learn node embeddings. Meanwhile, we propose a minimum-entropy based clustering strategy to cluster nodes in the embedding space for each graph. We introduce two regularizers to leverage both within-graph and cross-graph dependencies. An attentive mechanism is further developed to learn cross-graph cluster associations. Through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, we observe that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.},

  abstract = {Community detection, aiming to group the graph nodes into clusters with dense inner-connection, is a fundamental graph mining task. Recently, it has been studied on the heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple types of nodes and edges, posing great challenges for modeling the high-order relationship between nodes. With the surge of graph embedding mechanism, it has also been adopted to community detection. A remarkable group of works use the meta-path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes and embed them into nodes’ embedding to facilitate community detection. However, defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose to exploit the context path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes, and build a Context Path-based Graph Neural Network (CP-GNN) model. It recursively embeds the high-order relationship between nodes into the node embedding with attention mechanisms to discriminate the importance of different relationships. By maximizing the expectation of the co-occurrence of nodes connected by context paths, the model can learn the nodes’ embeddings that both well preserve the high-order relationship between nodes and are helpful for community detection. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets show that CP-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art community detection methods 1.},

Using daily returns from July 2001 to September 2019, we used minimum spanning tree and planar maximally filtered graph techniques to forecast the stock market realized volatility of 26 countries. We test the predictive power of our core models versus forecasting benchmarks models in and out of the sample. Our results show that the length of the minimum spanning tree is relevant to forecast volatility in European and Asian stock markets, improving forecasting models’ performance. As a new contribution, the evidence from this work establishes a road map to deepening the understanding of how financial networks can improve the quality of prediction of financial variables, being the latter, a crucial factor during financial shocks, where uncertainty and volatility skyrocket.},

  abstract = {Stochastic blockmodels (SBM) and their variants, e.g., mixed-membership and overlapping stochastic blockmodels, are latent variable based generative models for graphs. They have proven to be successful for various tasks, such as discovering the community structure and link prediction on graph-structured data. Recently, graph neural networks, e.g., graph convolutional networks, have also emerged as a promising approach to learn powerful representations (embeddings) for the nodes in the graph, by exploiting graph properties such as locality and invariance. In this work, we unify these two directions by developing a sparse variational autoencoder for graphs, that retains the interpretability of SBMs, while also enjoying the excellent predictive performance of graph neural nets. Moreover, our framework is accompanied by a fast recognition model that enables fast inference of the node embeddings (which are of independent interest for inference in SBM and its variants). Although we develop this framework for a particular type of SBM, namely the overlapping stochastic blockmodel, the proposed framework can be adapted readily for other types of SBMs. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate encouraging results on link prediction while learning an interpretable latent structure that can be used for community discovery.},

Most existing embedding algorithms typically focus on preserving the topological structure or minimizing the reconstruction errors of graph data, but they have mostly ignored the data distribution of the latent codes from the graphs, which often results in inferior embedding in realworld graph data. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial graph embedding framework for graph data. The framework encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph to a compact representation, on which a decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, the latent representation is enforced to match a prior distribution via an adversarial training scheme. To learn a robust embedding, two variants of adversarial approaches, adversarially regularized graph autoencoder (ARGA) and adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder (ARVGA), are developed. Experimental studies on real-world graphs validate our design and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines by a wide margin in link prediction, graph clustering, and graph visualization tasks.},

However, most existing network embedding methods assume that only a single type of relation exists between nodes. Even for those that consider the multiplexity of a network, they overlook node attributes, resort to node labels for training, and fail to model the global properties of a graph. We present a simple yet effective unsupervised network embedding method for attributed multiplex network called DMGI, inspired by Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) that maximizes the mutual information between local patches of a graph, and the global representation of the entire graph. We devise a systematic way to jointly integrate the node embeddings from multiple graphs by introducing 1) the consensus regularization framework that minimizes the disagreements among the relation-type specific node embeddings, and 2) the universal discriminator that discriminates true samples regardless of the relation types. We also show that the attention mechanism infers the importance of each relation type, and thus can be useful for filtering unnecessary relation types as a preprocessing step. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate that DMGI outperforms the stateof-the-art methods, even though DMGI is fully unsupervised.},

In fact, the knowledge of how objects organize allows a better understanding of a network, and gives a deeper insight of interesting characteristics, that could not be caught if considering the network as a whole. In the last decade, evolutionary computation techniques have given a significant contribution in this context. The aim of this review is to present the approaches based on evolutionary computation to uncover community structure.

A novel and fascinating problem started capturing researcher interest recently: the identification of evolving communities. Dynamic networks can be used to model the evolution of a system: nodes and edges are mutable, and their presence, or absence, deeply impacts the community structure that composes them.

Given a definition of network dynamics, desired community characteristics, and analytical needs, this survey will support researchers to identify the set of approaches that best fit their needs.

  abstract = {We present a probabilistic framework for community discovery and link prediction for graph-structured data, based on a novel, gamma ladder variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture. We model each node in the graph via a deep hierarchy of gamma-distributed embeddings, and define each link probability via a nonlinear function of the bottom-most layer’s embeddings of its associated nodes. In addition to leveraging the representational power of multiple layers of stochastic variables via the ladder VAE architecture, our framework offers the following benefits: (1) Unlike existing ladder VAE architectures based on real-valued latent variables, the gammadistributed latent variables naturally result in non-negativity and sparsity of the learned embeddings, and facilitate their direct interpretation as membership of nodes into (possibly multiple) communities/topics; (2) A novel recognition model for our gamma ladder VAE architecture allows fast inference of node embeddings; and (3) The framework also extends naturally to incorporate node side information (features and/or labels). Our framework is also fairly modular and can leverage a wide variety of graph neural networks as the VAE encoder. We report both quantitative and qualitative results on several benchmark datasets and compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Community detection is a fundamental problem in machine learning. While deep learning has shown great promise in many graphrelated tasks, developing neural models for community detection has received surprisingly little attention. The few existing approaches focus on detecting disjoint communities, even though communities in real graphs are well known to be overlapping. We address this shortcoming and propose a graph neural network (GNN) based model for overlapping community detection. Despite its simplicity, our model outperforms the existing baselines by a large margin in the task of community recovery. We establish through an extensive experimental evaluation that the proposed model is effective, scalable and robust to hyperparameter settings. We also perform an ablation study that confirms that GNN is the key ingredient to the power of the proposed model.

  abstract = {Network embedding has attracted an increasing attention over the past few years. As an effective approach to solve graph mining problems, network embedding aims to learn a low-dimensional feature vector representation for each node of a given network. The vast majority of existing network embedding algorithms, however, are only designed for unsigned networks, and the signed networks containing both positive and negative links, have pretty distinct properties from the unsigned counterpart. In this paper, we propose a deep network embedding model to learn the low-dimensional node vector representations with structural balance preservation for the signed networks. The model employs a semisupervised stacked auto-encoder to reconstruct the adjacency connections of a given signed network. As the adjacency connections are overwhelmingly positive in the real-world signed networks, we impose a larger penalty to make the auto-encoder focus more on reconstructing the scarce negative links than the abundant positive links. In addition, to preserve the structural balance property of signed networks, we design the pairwise constraints to make the positively connected nodes much closer than the negatively connected nodes in the embedding space. Based on the network representations learned by the proposed model, we conduct link sign prediction and community detection in signed networks. Extensive experimental results in real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms for graph representation learning in signed networks.},

While the encoder is often a powerful graph convolutional network, the decoder reconstructs the graph structure by only considering two nodes at a time, thus ignoring possible interactions among edges. On the other hand, structured prediction, which considers the whole graph simultaneously, is computationally expensive. In this paper, we utilize the well-known triadic closure property which is exhibited in many real-world networks. We propose the triad decoder, which considers and predicts the three edges involved in a local triad together. The triad decoder can be readily used in any graph-based auto-encoder. In particular, we incorporate this to the (variational) graph auto-encoder. Experiments on link prediction, node clustering and graph generation show that the use of triads leads to more accurate prediction, clustering and better preservation of the graph characteristics.},

When presented with imbalanced class distributions, existing graph embedding learning tends to bias to nodes from majority classes, leaving nodes from minority classes under-trained. In this paper, we propose DualRegularized Graph Convolutional Networks (DRGCN) to handle multi-class imbalanced graphs, where two types of regularization are imposed to tackle class imbalanced representation learning. To ensure that all classes are equally represented, we propose a class-conditioned adversarial training process to facilitate the separation of labeled nodes. Meanwhile, to maintain training equilibrium (i.e., retaining quality of fit across all classes), we force unlabeled nodes to follow a similar latent distribution to the labeled nodes by minimizing their difference in the embedding space. Experiments on real-world imbalanced graphs demonstrate that DR-GCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in node classification, graph clustering, and visualization.},

In this work, we explore the possibility of employing deep learning in graph clustering. We propose a simple method, which first learns a nonlinear embedding of the original graph by stacked autoencoder, and then runs k-means algorithm on the embedding to obtain clustering result. We show that this simple method has solid theoretical foundation, due to the similarity between autoencoder and spectral clustering in terms of what they actually optimize. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient and flexible than spectral clustering. First, the computational complexity of autoencoder is much lower than spectral clustering: the former can be linear to the number of nodes in a sparse graph while the latter is super quadratic due to eigenvalue decomposition. Second, when additional sparsity constraint is imposed, we can simply employ the sparse autoencoder developed in the literature of deep learning; however, it is nonstraightforward to implement a sparse spectral method. The experimental results on various graph datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional spectral clustering, which clearly indicates the effectiveness of deep learning in graph clustering.},

Recent studies have mostly focused on developing deep learning approaches to learn a compact graph embedding, upon which classic clustering methods like k-means or spectral clustering algorithms are applied. These two-step frameworks are difficult to manipulate and usually lead to suboptimal performance, mainly because the graph embedding is not goal-directed, i.e., designed for the specific clustering task. In this paper, we propose a goal-directed deep learning approach, Deep Attentional Embedded Graph Clustering (DAEGC for short). Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. By employing an attention network to capture the importance of the neighboring nodes to a target node, our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph to a compact representation, on which an inner product decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels from the graph embedding itself are generated to supervise a self-training graph clustering process, which iteratively refines the clustering results. The selftraining process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding in a unified framework, to mutually benefit both components. Experimental results compared with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

Most existing works can be considered as generative models that approximate the underlying node connectivity distribution in the network, or as discriminate models that predict edge existence under a specific discriminative task. Although several recent works try to unify the two types of models with adversarial learning to improve the performance, they only consider the local pairwise connectivity between nodes. Higher-order structural information such as communities, which essentially reflects the global topology structure of the network, is largely ignored. To this end, we propose a novel framework called CANE to simultaneously learn the node representations and identify the network communities. The two tasks are integrated and mutually reinforce each other under a novel adversarial learning framework. Specifically, with the detected communities, CANE jointly minimizes the pairwise connectivity loss and the community assignment error to improve node representation learning. In turn, the learned node representations provide high-quality features to facilitate community detection. Experimental results on multiple real datasets demonstrate that CANE achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines in various applications including link prediction, node classification, recommendation, network visualization, and community detection.},

The evolutionary clustering framework provides a temporal smoothness constraint for simultaneously maximizing the clustering quality at the current time step and minimizing the clustering deviation between two successive time steps. Based on this framework, some existing methods, such as the evolutionary spectral clustering and evolutionary nonnegative matrix factorization, aim to look for the low-dimensional representation by mapping reconstruction. However, such reconstruction does not address the nonlinear characteristics of networks. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm (sE-Autoencoder) to overcome the effects of nonlinear property on the low-dimensional representation. Our proposed method extends the typical nonlinear reconstruction model to the dynamic network by constructing a temporal matrix. More specifically, the potential community characteristics and the previous clustering, as the prior information, are incorporated into the loss function as a regularization term. Experimental results on synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and superior to other methods for dynamic community detection.},

However, existing deep approaches for graph clustering can only exploit the structure information, while ignoring the content information associated with the nodes in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel marginalized graph autoencoder (MGAE) algorithm for graph clustering. e key innovation of MGAE is that it advances the autoencoder to the graph domain, so graph representation learning can be carried out not only in a purely unsupervised se ing by leveraging structure and content information, it can also be stacked in a deep fashion to learn e ective representation. From a technical viewpoint, we propose a marginalized graph convolutional network to corrupt network node content, allowing node content to interact with network features, and marginalizes the corrupted features in a graph autoencoder context to learn graph feature representations. e learned features are fed into the spectral clustering algorithm for graph clustering.

  abstract = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) as an emerging technique have shown superior capacity of dealing with heterogeneous information network (HIN). However, most HGNNs follow a semi-supervised learning manner, which notably limits their wide use in reality since labels are usually scarce in real applications. Recently, contrastive learning, a self-supervised method, becomes one of the most exciting learning paradigms and shows great potential when there are no labels. In this paper, we study the problem of self-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for HGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only focuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs cross-view contrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network schema and meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to capture both of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the cross-view contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed, which is able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views. This enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally learn high-level node embeddings. Moreover, two extensions of HeCo are designed to generate harder negative samples with high quality, which further boosts the performance of HeCo. Extensive experiments conducted on a variety of real-world networks show the superior performance of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract = {Community detection has emerged during the last decade as one of the most challenging problems in network science, which has been revisited with network representation learning recently and has attracted considerable attention. Many approaches have been proposed in recent years, including the latest methods based on graph convolutional network (GCN). Here, we propose a new network representation learning method based on GCN for community detection in attributed networks without prior label information. Inspired by the message pass mechanism of GCN and the local self-organizing property of community structure, we integrate a label sampling model and GCN into an unsupervised learning framework to uncover underlying community structures by fusing topology and attribute information. The label sampling model constructs a balanced training set by structural center location and neighbor node expansion to train the GCN. The experiments on various real-world networks give a comparison view to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs more efficiently with a comparative performance over current state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.},

  abstract = {Despite the promising preliminary results, existing graph convolutional network (GCN) based multi-view learning methods directly use the graph structure as view descriptor, which may inhibit the ability of multi-view learning for multimedia data. The major reason is that, in real multimedia applications, the graph structure may contain outliers. Moreover, they fail to take advantage of the information embedded in the inaccurate clustering labels obtained from their proposed methods, resulting in inferior clustering results. These observations motivate us to study whether there is a better alternative GCN based framework for multi-view clustering. To this end, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised graph convolutional network for multi-view clustering (SGCMC). Specifically, SGCMC constructs a new view descriptor for graph-structured data by mapping the raw node content into the complex space via Euler transformation, which not only suppresses outliers but also reveals non-linear patterns embedded in data. Meanwhile, the proposed SGCMC uses the clustering labels to guide the learning of the latent representation and coefficient matrix, and the latter in turn is used to conduct the subsequent node clustering. By this way, clustering and representation learning are seamlessly connected, with the aim to achieve better clustering results. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed SGCMC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Moreover, most existing graph embedding clustering methods execute the nodes representations learning and clustering in two separated steps, which increases the instability of its original performance. Additionally, rare of them simultaneously takes node attributes reconstruction and graph structure reconstruction into account, resulting in degrading the capability of graph learning. In this work, we integrate the nodes representations learning and clustering into a unified framework, and propose a new deep graph attention auto-encoder for nodes clustering that attempts to learn more favorable nodes representations by leveraging self-attention mechanism and node attributes reconstruction. Meanwhile, a cluster-specificity distribution constraint, which is measured by ℓ1,2-norm, is employed to make the nodes representations within the same cluster end up with a common distribution in the dimension space while representations with different clusters have different distributions in the intrinsic dimensions. Extensive experiment results reveal that our proposed method is superior to several state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.},

Recent literature on this topic has reached a consensus that node contents and link structures should be integrated for reliable graph clustering, especially in an unsupervised setting. However, existing methods based on shallow models o en su er from content noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose to utilize deep embedding for graph clustering, motivated by the well-recognized power of neural networks in learning intrinsic content representations. Upon that, we capture the dynamic nature of networks through the principle of in uence propagation and calculate the dynamic network embedding. Network clusters are then detected based on the stable state of such an embedding. Unlike most existing embedding methods that are task-agnostic, we simultaneously solve for the underlying node representations and the optimal clustering assignments in an end-to-end manner. To provide more insight, we theoretically analyze our interpretation of network clusters and nd its underlying connections with two widely applied approaches for network modeling. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets including both social networks and citation networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art.},

However, this important ability is lost in existing adversarially regularized network embedding methods, because their embedding results are directly compared to the samples drawn from perturbation (Gaussian) distribution without any rectification from real data. To overcome this vital issue, a novel Joint Adversarial Network Embedding (JANE) framework is proposed to jointly distinguish the real and fake combinations of the embeddings, topology information and node features. JANE contains three pluggable components, Embedding module, Generator module and Discriminator module. The overall objective function of JANE is defined in a min-max form, which can be optimized via alternating stochastic gradient.

While designed with different objectives, i.e., stochastic models for regeneration and modularity maximization models for discrimination, both these two types of model look for low-rank embedding to best represent and reconstruct network topology. However, the mapping through such embedding is linear, whereas real networks have various nonlinear features, making these models less effective in practice. Inspired by the strong representation power of deep neural networks, we propose a novel nonlinear reconstruction method by adopting deep neural networks for representation. We then extend the method to a semi-supervised community detection algorithm by incorporating pairwise constraints among graph nodes.

Unlike what has been developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data, self-supervised learning and pre-training are less explored for GNNs. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) framework for learning unsupervised representations of graph data. We first design four types of graph augmentations to incorporate various priors. We then systematically study the impact of various combinations of graph augmentations on multiple datasets, in four different settings: semi-supervised, unsupervised, and transfer learning as well as adversarial attacks. The results show that, even without tuning augmentation extents nor using sophisticated GNN architectures, our GraphCL framework can produce graph representations of similar or better generalizability, transferrability, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also investigate the impact of parameterized graph augmentation extents and patterns, and observe further performance gains in preliminary experiments.

  abstract = {Attributed graph clustering is challenging as it requires joint modelling of graph structures and node attributes. Recent progress on graph convolutional networks has proved that graph convolution is effective in combining structural and content information, and several recent methods based on it have achieved promising clustering performance on some real attributed networks. However, there is limited understanding of how graph convolution affects clustering performance and how to properly use it to optimize performance for different graphs. Existing methods essentially use graph convolution of a fixed and low order that only takes into account neighbours within a few hops of each node, which underutilizes node relations and ignores the diversity of graphs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive graph convolution method for attributed graph clustering that exploits high-order graph convolution to capture global cluster structure and adaptively selects the appropriate order for different graphs. We establish the validity of our method by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Empirical results show that our method compares favourably with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Network embedding aims at projecting the network data into a low-dimensional feature space, where the nodes are represented as a unique feature vector and network structure can be effectively preserved. In recent years, more and more online application service sites can be represented as massive and complex networks, which are extremely challenging for traditional machine learning algorithms to deal with. Effective embedding of the complex network data into lowdimension feature representation can both save data storage space and enable traditional machine learning algorithms applicable to handle the network data. Network embedding performance will degrade greatly if the networks are of a sparse structure, like the emerging networks with few connections. In this paper, we propose to learn the embedding representation for a target emerging network based on the broad learning setting, where the emerging network is aligned with other external mature networks at the same time. To solve the problem, a new embedding framework, namely “Deep alIgned autoencoder based eMbEdding” (DIME), is introduced in this paper. DIME handles the diverse link and attribute in a unified analytic based on broad learning, and introduces the multiple aligned attributed heterogeneous social network concept to model the network structure. A set of meta paths are introduced in the paper, which define various kinds of connections among users via the heterogeneous link and attribute information. The closeness among users in the networks are defined as the meta proximity scores, which will be fed into DIME to learn the embedding vectors of users in the emerging network. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world aligned social networks, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of DIME in learning the emerging network embedding vectors.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of information technologies, information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, telecommunication networks, and biological networks. Analyzing these networks sheds light on different aspects of social life such as the structure of societies, information diffusion, and communication patterns. In reality, however, the large scale of information networks often makes network analytic tasks computationally expensive or intractable. Network representation learning has been recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network vertices into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure, vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the original network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature on network representation learning in the data mining and machine learning field. We propose new taxonomies to categorize and summarize the state-of-the-art network representation learning techniques according to the underlying learning mechanisms, the network information intended to preserve, as well as the algorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize evaluation protocols used for validating network representation learning including published benchmark datasets, evaluation methods, and open source algorithms. We also perform empirical studies to compare the performance of representative algorithms on common datasets, and analyze their computational complexity. Finally, we suggest promising research directions to facilitate future study.},

  abstract = {Community detection is an important task with many applications. However, there is no universal definition of communities, and a variety of algorithms have been proposed based on different assumptions. In this paper, we instead study the semi-supervised community detection problem where we are given several communities in a network as training data and aim to discover more communities. This setting makes it possible to learn concepts of communities from data without any prior knowledge. We propose the Seed Expansion with generative Adversarial Learning (SEAL), a framework for learning heuristics for community detection. SEAL contains a generative adversarial network, where the discriminator predicts whether a community is real or fake, and the generator generates communities that cheat the discriminator by implicitly fitting characteristics of real ones. The generator is a graph neural network specialized in sequential decision processes and gets trained by policy gradient. Moreover, a locator is proposed to avoid well-known free-rider effects by forming a dual learning task with the generator. Last but not least, a seed selector is utilized to provide promising seeds to the generator. We evaluate SEAL on 5 real-world networks and prove its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Attributed graph clustering aims to discover node groups by utilizing both graph structure and node features. Recent studies mostly adopt graph neural networks to learn node embeddings, then apply traditional clustering methods to obtain clusters. However, they usually suffer from the following issues: (1) they adopt original graph structure which is unfavorable for clustering due to its noise and sparsity problems; (2) they mainly utilize non-clustering driven losses that cannot well capture the global cluster structure, thus the learned embeddings are not sufficient for the downstream clustering task. In this paper, we propose a spectral embedding network for attributed graph clustering (SENet), which improves graph structure by leveraging the information of shared neighbors, and learns node embeddings with the help of a spectral clustering loss. By combining the original graph structure and shared neighbor based similarity, both the first-order and second-order proximities are encoded into the improved graph structure, thus alleviating the noise and sparsity issues. To make the spectral loss well adapt to attributed graphs, we integrate both structure and feature information into kernel matrix via a higher-order graph convolution. Experiments on benchmark attributed graphs show that SENet achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {By contrasting positive-negative counterparts, graph contrastive learning has become a prominent technique for unsupervised graph representation learning. However, existing methods fail to consider the class information and will introduce false-negative samples in the random negative sampling, causing poor performance. To this end, we propose a graph debiased contrastive learning framework, which can jointly perform representation learning and clustering. Specifically, representations can be optimized by aligning with clustered class information, and simultaneously, the optimized representations can promote clustering, leading to more powerful representations and clustering results. More importantly, we randomly select negative samples from the clusters which are different from the positive sample’s cluster. In this way, as the supervisory signals, the clustering results can be utilized to effectively decrease the false-negative samples. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on graph clustering and classification tasks.},
