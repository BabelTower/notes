  abstract = {Building on realized variance and bipower variation measures constructed from high-frequency financial prices, we propose a simple reduced form framework for effectively incorporating intraday data into the modeling of daily return volatility. We decompose the total daily return variability into the continuous sample path variance, the variation arising from discontinuous jumps that occur during the trading day, as well as the overnight return variance. Our empirical results, based on long samples of highfrequency equity and bond futures returns, suggest that the dynamic dependencies in the daily continuous sample path variability are well described by an approximate long-memory HAR–GARCH model, while the overnight returns may be modeled by an augmented GARCH type structure. The dynamic dependencies in the non-parametrically identified significant jumps appear to be well described by the combination of an ACH model for the time-varying jump intensities coupled with a relatively simple log-linear structure for the jump sizes. Finally, we discuss how the resulting reduced form model structure for each of the three components may be used in the construction of out-of-sample forecasts for the total return volatility.},

  abstract = {We propose a new family of easy-to-implement realized volatility based forecasting models. The models exploit the asymptotic theory for high-frequency realized volatility estimation to improve the accuracy of the forecasts. By allowing the parameters of the models to vary explicitly with the (estimated) degree of measurement error, the models exhibit stronger persistence, and in turn generate more responsive forecasts, when the measurement error is relatively low. Implementing the new class of models for the S\&P500 equity index and the individual constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we document significant improvements in the accuracy of the resulting forecasts compared to the forecasts from some of the most popular existing models that implicitly ignore the temporal variation in the magnitude of the realized volatility measurement errors.},

  abstract = {We propose a dynamic model for financial market volatility with an heterogeneous structure for three components: continuous volatiilty, leverage and jumps. We find that each of the three components plays a significant role in volatility forecasting and neglecting one of them is detrimental to the forecasting performance. Importantly, we find remarkable forecasting power for the negative past returns at all the considered frequencies, which unveils a novel heterogeneous structure in the leverage effect. We also show, using simulation studies, that the presence of jumps is important for two distinct reasons: Firstly, explicitly modeling jumps has trimming effect on the dynamics of the persistent volatility component; secondly, they have a positive and significant impact on future volatility.},

The construction of “observable” or realized volatility series from intra-day transaction data and the use of standard time-series techniques has lead to promising strategies for modeling and predicting (daily) volatility. In this article, we show that the residuals of commonly used time-series models for realized volatility and logarithmic realized variance exhibit non-Gaussianity and volatility clustering. We propose extensions to explicitly account for these properties and assess their relevance for modeling and forecasting realized volatility. In an empirical application for S\&P 500 index futures we show that allowing for time-varying volatility of realized volatility and logarithmic realized variance substantially improves the fit as well as predictive performance. Furthermore, the distributional assumption for residuals plays a crucial role in density forecasting.},

Then, we use high-frequency transaction data for five minutes of the CSI 300 stock index as the study sample, which, respectively, make parameter estimation on the SV, SV-RV, and SV-CJ model. We also comparatively analyze these three models' prediction accuracy by using the loss functions and SPA test. The results indicate that the prior logarithmic realized volatility and the logarithmic continuous sample path variation can be used to predict the future return volatility in China's stock market, while the logarithmic discontinuous jump variation is poor at its prediction accuracy. Besides, the SV-CJ model has an obvious advantage over the SV and SV-RV model as to the prediction accuracy of the return volatility, and it is more suitable for the research concerning the problems of financial practice such as the financial risk management.},

We find significant structural breaks in the volatility of crude oil futures. Additionally, the historical realized volatility, continuous sample path variation, negative realized semivariance, signed jump, signed semi-jump and leverage components contain substantial and salient information for forecasting the volatility of crude oil futures. Then, we use loss functions to assess the forecasting performance of these sixteen new models, and finally, rank these models using the PROMETHEE II method. Our results indicate that different models exhibit different predictive power in forecasting the 1-day, 1-week and 1-month volatility of crude oil futures. Of the new HAR-type models, the new HAR-RSV model performs best at forecasting the 1-day and 1-month volatilities, whereas the new HAR-CJ best forecasts the 1-week volatility.},
